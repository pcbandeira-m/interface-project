                    <h2>The Hobbit, from J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>

                <section>

                    <p>It is difficult to find works with a legacy as massive as that of The Hobbit. Its impact spans
                        across literature, the fantasy and adventure genres, and the creation of various clichés and
                        archetypes still used in "Hero's Journey" narratives today—not to mention its even grander
                        sequel, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. What J.R.R. Tolkien achieved with his 1937 book cannot be
                        quantified; yet, curiously, as the preface informs us, Middle-earth was born from an extremely
                        simple form of storytelling:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One can feel this causality in Tolkien’s prose and the book's episodic structure. An omniscient
                        narrator describes the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit (a small being with furry
                        feet), who sets out on a great journey with the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves to face the
                        dragon Smaug and reclaim the dwarves' treasure and castle. The English author’s writing style is
                        highly reminiscent of fables and fairy tales, describing his world and fantastic figures in a
                        way that makes us imagine every aspect of this universe, as if the readers themselves were his
                        children discovering Middle-earth through his words.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this sense, there is a childlike lightness to The Hobbit. Its narrative and prose seek wonder
                        through mythological creativity and a pure sense of adventure rather than a dense, dramatic
                        plot. Thus, the book differs significantly from the grandeur and epic "Good vs. Evil" tone of
                        The Lord of the Rings; Tolkien’s prelude takes a more charming approach, featuring several
                        comedic scenarios and a largely unpretentious plot.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On one hand, this creates a certain lack of urgency, which is heightened by the work's weak
                        climax during the Battle of the Five Armies. The conflict is poorly established, happens too
                        quickly, and ends anticlimactically (including the protagonist fainting). It is evident that
                        Tolkien was not yet as sharp or focused on the narrative elements—such as twists, arcs, and plot
                        convergence—preferring instead to focus on mythology. This is seen in his dedication to
                        describing geography, nature, regions, and creatures, all fueled by immense imagination and
                        influences ranging from Norse mythology and medieval events to Christianity and poetry. The
                        latter is reinforced by the author’s poetic approach and the frequent inclusion of songs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, it is hard to find a more genuine and charming adventure than The Hobbit. The
                        book is filled with playful situations, such as the dwarves introducing themselves to Bilbo by
                        eating everything in his house, the escape from elven prisons in barrels, and the interactions
                        with Gandalf, who always seems to be poking fun at the little ones. Most notably, the riddles
                        Bilbo shares with both Smaug and Gollum are, in my opinion, the best part of the book. Tolkien
                        has a gift for rhymes, wordplay, and British sarcasm, making the dialogues priceless and the
                        riddles genuinely challenging for the reader.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, Tolkien's best trait is the adventurous essence of the work. He leads us through
                        Bilbo’s quests with enchantment and naturalness, making the artist's passion for his universe
                        palpable. At times, Tolkien becomes overly enamored with the details of Middle-earth, but it is
                        nearly impossible not to be dazzled by the corners of this world and its unforgettable
                        figures—even those who only appear for a chapter or two, like Smaug, Gollum, and Beorn.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite being episodic, Bilbo's adventure has good progression, and it is incredible how each
                        "episode" (escapes, riddles, battles, thefts) has a distinct flavor. Even objects receive
                        special attention, from Bilbo's sword to the Arkenstone and, of course, the Ring. It is
                        undoubtedly one of the best mythological stories in literature.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Bilbo is the essential piece that makes the adventure work with such authenticity. Tolkien was
                        brilliant in choosing an ordinary, tiny protagonist with no obvious heroic qualities—a mirror
                        for the reader and for children. He is not your typical hero, which makes his journey relatable.
                        He is discovering the world alongside us, while Tolkien utilizes "Hero's Journey"
                        tropes—personal growth, courage, honor—to build his arc. In this context, the Ring serves as an
                        allegory, giving Bilbo the chance to reveal his bravery and, especially, his cunning. I love how
                        many fantastic situations are resolved with simple logic and common sense, even as the story
                        touches on greed, one of Tolkien's central themes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If The Hobbit is one of the purest fantasy books of all time, then Bilbo is one of the genre's
                        best protagonists. While I see flaws in the narrative and the ending, and don't necessarily
                        consider it a "flawless masterpiece," it is impossible not to be charmed by it. Whether through
                        its simplicity or the legendary creativity of its world-building, it remains one of the most
                        special and classic readings literature has ever gifted us.
